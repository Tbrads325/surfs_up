## Overview of Analysis

W.Avy wanted more information on temperature trends specifically for the months of June and December. Thus, more
queries were performed to find the summary statistics of the history of the temperatures during these two months.

## Results

### June Temp Summary Statistics
![June_Temp]()
### Decemeber Temp Summary Statistics
![Dec_Temp]()

- The first noticable statistic is the mean temperature for each month. June has a mean temperature of 74.944118 while
December has a mean temerature of 71.041529 both of which are not too far apart. Thus, this depicts the temperature as relatively
stable throughout the year in Oahu.

- Meanwhile, the quartiles all are relatively close just as the mean. This provides yet more evidence that the temperature in Oahu
will stay relatively the same year round.

- Finally, the minimum temperature recorded in December was 56 degrees which shouldn't be disregarded. However, if this is the lowest temperature that
the shop will have to deal with during the year then it is a good sign. 

## Summary

It would also be useful to see the precipitation summary statistics for the months of June and December. Thus, two new queries to obtain this
information and the summary statistics would be helpful. 

### June Precipitation Summary Statistics
![June_Prec]()
### December Precipitation Summary Statistics
![Dec_Prec]()

These tables show that we can expect the precipitation levels/amounts to be higher in the month of December in comparison to June.
